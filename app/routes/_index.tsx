                    {/* Coherence and cohesion: The essay is generally well-structured
                  with an introduction, body paragraphs discussing each
                  viewpoint, and a clear opinion stated in the conclusion. The
                  writer uses transition words like "however," "otherwise," and
                  "as a consequence" to link ideas within and between sentences.
                  However, there are some issues with clarity in some sentences,
                  such as "It can be less risk-taking in comparison with private
                  support," which could be rephrased for better coherence.
                  Overall, the essay demonstrates a good level of coherence and
                  cohesion but could benefit from further clarity. Lexical
                  resource: The writer demonstrates a wide range of vocabulary
                  by using varied terms such as "prosperity," "bureaucracy,"
                  "self-development," and "imbalance." Some less common and more
                  sophisticated vocabulary choices, such as "monetary backing"
                  instead of "financial support," could enhance the essay's
                  lexical resource further. However, there are instances of
                  awkward or unclear phrasing, such as "I tend to thing that the
                  combined funding are more valuable," which affects the overall
                  lexical resource score. Grammatical range and accuracy: The
                  writer shows a good range of grammatical structures, including
                  complex sentences and conditional clauses. Some errors in
                  subject-verb agreement ("the creative crowd will have many
                  more choices") and word choice ("thing" instead of "think")
                  are present. Additionally, there are a few instances of
                  awkward phrasing that affect clarity, such as "When companies'
                  offer a great support, authorities can delegate this duty."
                  Overall, the essay demonstrates a good command of grammar but
                  would benefit from more accuracy and precision in expression.
                  Overall, this essay demonstrates a sufficient level of English
                  proficiency for IELTS Writing Task 2, particularly in
                  coherence and cohesion and lexical resource. However,
                  improvements in grammatical accuracy and clarity of expression
                  could elevate the essay to a higher band score. This essay
                  would likely score around Band 6. */}

                      Others argue that this support should come from other

                      support. Some people say that the talented people should
                      be supported by government, and others consider that
                      fundings should be received from companies and
                      corporations. In my opinion, if the creative people has
                      financial support from both places, they have more options
                      to choose from. */}
